        <h2>Lion's Blood</h2>
        <h3>on‚Äôs Blood is an alternate history novel discussing a hypothetical African scenario where technolopgically advanced black kingdoms conquered and enslaved white Europeans. This scenario seems as though it‚Äôs designed to make the reader uncomfortable, and question their viewpoints on many parts of history. Firstly, it portrays Europeans as primitive. This is very similar to the narrative of pre-colonial Africa that many Europeans often push, the idea that an entire continent of people is ‚Äòbackwards‚Äô or ‚Äòprimitive.‚Äô This type of description can make the reader question the use of these terms and their application in various scenarios. Psychologically, when white people see their ‚Äòown kind‚Äô portrayed in an allegedly unfavorable way, it creates some form of inexplicable resentment. In many history textbooks, Europeans are portrayed as the technologically advanced civilization, holding very positive characteristics. To the privileged, any form of equality seems like discrimination. This narrative pushed by the book is a prime example of what I think would‚Äôve been the reaction to this novel. </h3>
        <h3>Furthermore, the reversed narrative of the white savior, which is a common trope in many American movies, is another significant characteristic of this novel. In particular, Kai is portrayed as the hero of the film, liberating the whites from enslavement. This is a reverse of the white savior narrative, where a white character is often praised by black side characters for their heroic role. To an extent, even Afro-futurism films have expressed a white savior narrative to increase their viewership. In Black Panther (2017 Film), the CIA agent known as Everett Ross was instrumental in stopping Wakandan weapons from leaving the country. I subscribe to the idea that the reason this character was included was to give the white audience a character to place themselves in, as due to societal values, many people psychologically cannot place themselves into the shoes of someone they do not relate with, and this remains true with the white audience and black heroic characters. It was once said that the reason Hollywood never made a film on the Haitian revolution is because there would be no white savior narrative to push. In many slave revolts in North and South American history, there was no white savior, despite history textbooks‚Äô main ambitions. Portraying a black savior in this movie was a great way to illustrate the irony of many historical narratives. </h3>
        <h3>This last paragraph has little to do with the previous ones, but I really enjoyed reading the direct historical narrative about African history including all of the African Empires that became rich, and the names they gave American places, such as ‚ÄúNew Djibouti.‚Äù As well as all of the relationship between Bilalistan and the Aztecs. </h3>
