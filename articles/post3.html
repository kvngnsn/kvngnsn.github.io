        <h2>Daughters of the Dust</h2>
        <h3>Daughters of the Dust is an independently written and directed film starring a Gullah community (creole group in the Southern United States). The story undergoes and represents many themes including culture clashes between traditional African spiritual culture, and Western culture, economic development and the perception of ‚Äòbackwardsness,‚Äô as well as the creole communities of not just the United States but also the Caribbean. A particular aspect of the film I‚Äôd like to focus on, is the theme regarding economic development and the alleged ‚Äòbackwardsness‚Äô of the creole communities. Many people, including my TA have a tough time interpreting why this film is considered Afro-futurism in the first place. I sympathize with this viewpoint, as the film is set in 1902, and is more of a drama at first glance. However, the theme of futurism is deeper embroiled in the plot. The desire of the characters to pursue economic opportunities, such as the Peazent family‚Äôs decision to embark on a journey leaving the island, represents a factor that is deeply rooted in African history and African politics. The desire to create economic development is a narrative deeply rooted in African political history. This narrative manifested itself due to the decades of colonialism causing deindustrialization, economic neglect, and resource exploitation for the benefit of European colonial powers. </h3>
        <h3>In particular, France implemented a currency system designed to import the natural resources of Africa, and export the finished goods of Europe. Local industries in Africa were largely confined to resource exploitation, leading them to be solely relient on Europeans for basic essentials such as textiles, food, or manufactured goods. European powers deliberately prevented them from producing their own commodities. Even after colonialism ended, this system pursued in many former French colonies. For example, in Ivory Coast, the country essentially ran on one commodity: Export of Cocoa, largely to France. Houphouet-Boigny, the French-appointed dictator, made no effort was made to develop industries outside of Cocoa production. The capital that resulted from any profits made by cocoa farmers largely flowed to France. </h3>
        <h3>However, former British colonies took a vastly different approach. In order to combat their perceived backwardsness, they blocked the import of European goods, and subsidized domestic production. This relates significantly to the narrative in Daughters of the Dust, as it showed that many African leaders were inspired by their colonial struggle to rise up, and improve their own economic conditions, combatting their perceived ‚Äòbackwardsness.‚Äô Leaders such as Kwame Nkrumah and Kenneth Kaunde sought rapid development for Ghana and Zambia respectively. While Nkrumah was eventually overthrown by a US-sponsored coup, the first half of his reign was marked by rapid growth, while the second half was not so successful. However, his intentions are greatly aligned with Africa‚Äôs desire to re-establish its former glory, and reach its true potential, a desire that is shared by authors of Afro-futurism. </h3>
