        <h1>How ‚ÄúDistrict 9‚Äù Combines Afro-Futurism with Historical Narrative</h1>
        <h4>By Kavin Ganesan (üìç District 9, South Africa)</h4>
        <img src="https://facts.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/43-facts-about-the-movie-district-9-1687517115.jpeg">
        <h2>District 9</h2>
        <h3>In the realm of Afro-Futurism, ‚ÄòDistrict 9,‚Äô a South-African-American co-production feature film, has to be one of the most interesting works in the genre. The first reason I say this is because it ingeniously combines both Afro-Futurism and History in a way that‚Äôs both obvious and hidden. The film‚Äôs rationale is inspired by the story of Black South Africans who were expelled from ‚ÄòDistrict 6‚Äô which had been reserved for the whites by the White-led South African government. In the story, ‚Äòaliens‚Äô from a different planet, which seems to be an analogy for the native South Africans, are forcibly relocated from District 9 to a different district. Despite this, it is very much not a historical narrative. The film involves spectres of Afro-futurism including aliens, spaceships, and the famous ‚Äòmothership‚Äô connection with Afro-Futurism. The way it‚Äôs able to blend these two makes it an inspirational work that I can learn a lot from in the process of writing my own short story (coming soon).</h3>
        <h3>Furthermore, the film keeps its undertone of historical narrative when analogizing to the history of South Africa. In particular, when South Africa was divided by race, there remained many categories including ‚ÄúWhite,‚Äù ‚ÄúColored,‚Äù ‚ÄúAsian,‚Äù ‚ÄúBlack,‚Äù and ‚ÄúBantu.‚Äù In particular, the last one often goes unrecognized often because they were the most oppressed of all. Bantu people were often those that resided in designated ‚Äòbantustans,‚Äô away from the major cities of Johannesburg, Durban, or Cape Town. These ‚Äòbantustans‚Äô were designated resource-poor, un-arable plots of land that these bantu communities were restricted to. Not only did they not have the same travel rights as whites in the mainland, but they did not even have the same rights as black and colored South Africans in the major cities. They were essentially treated as undesirables, forced into encampments to be contained as if they were some sort of disease. The alien narrative of this film, where the aliens were forced into a poverty-stricken encampment greatly resembles how these Bantu South Africans were treated, and reinforces the film‚Äôs narrative as both Afro-Futurism, and historical narrative.</h3>
        <h3>Furthermore, one thing i really liked about this film was its villanization of a corporation called ‚ÄòMultinational United.‚Äô In particular, the name of this corporation immediately sends the message necessary to convey what purpose this corporation serves. The explicitness of the name is hilarious to me. Overall it also conveys the problems with relying on multinational corporations, who often work for profit, to deal with matters that are essential to human life, such as land, migration, and humanity. It can be seen as a criticism of hypercapitalist principles that have led us to use profit incentives to get people to engage in human-centered activities, two things that seem completely incompatible.</h3>
