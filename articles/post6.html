        <h2>Afro-Futurism</h2>
        <h3>Afro-futurism is a highly interesting genre of literature with many rich themes and interesting nuances. For this blog post, i‚Äôve picked out three works that I think best represent the genre and all of its great history. Obviously it is very difficult to illustrate an entire genre purely based on a few works, but these works are highly nuanced and represent significant and important themes in Afro-futurism. With that said, the three works i‚Äôm choosing to discuss are: Black Panther (2018 Film), Parable of the Sower (Octavia Butler), and Lion‚Äôs Blood (Stephen Barnes).  </h3>
        <h3>Firstly, the crown jewel of Afro-futurism is Black Panther, the 2018 film. This remains by far the most popular work in Afro futurism, and for good reason. It represents the hopes and dreams of the African-American community, to live in a world with great technological advancements and a high standard of living, to be materially and technologically superior to other continents. It also represents the grievances in the black community and how they can manifest themselves. The injustices faced by black people across the world has created this shared struggle. As an outsider, sometimes it makes me wonder why this community doesn‚Äôt get more support. There are socio-political reasons behind this, but when reflecting on the history of black people over the past two centuries, the film can almost help you understand the antagonist‚Äôs perspective.  </h3>
        <h3>Next, Parable of the Sower takes a different approach. Instead of portraying a utopian society representing the hopes of the black community, it portrays almost the exact opposite. By portraying a dystopia where basic necessities are denied, crime is rampant, and corporations control the world, Octavia Butler almost illustrates a warning to the world of what we could turn into without proper regulation. It‚Äôs a form of dystopian Afro-futurism that represents something highly distinct from Black Panther‚Äôs utopia. </h3>
        <h3>Finally, my personal favorite work in Afro-futurism has to be Lion‚Äôs Blood. Firstly, the economic and historical implications and inspiration was super interesting. The discussion on the trade routes linking East and West, and how that could have changed with Stephen Barnes‚Äô rationale, was one that was super interesting to listen to. Furthermore, the economic history of Africa is something I‚Äôve written a brief blog post about. Post-colonialism, many African countries have been rightfully obsessed with development, as underdevelopment has plagued the continent for centuries. Even so, great empires (particularly in West Africa), such as Mali, Songhai, Benin, existed well into history. While these remain largely ignored by historians, the African history aspect was just really interesting for me to see represented.</h3>
